# Databricks Monitoring Agent PRD

## Project Overview
The Databricks Monitoring Agent is an intelligent system that automatically monitors Databricks workspaces, identifies issues, suggests and implements fixes, and verifies resolutions. The agent will be deployed on Azure and integrate with the Azure Agents SDK for advanced capabilities like hallucination detection and safety checks.

## Goals
1. Create an automated monitoring system for Databricks workspaces
2. Reduce time to resolution for common Databricks issues
3. Implement a reasoning loop to explain decisions and actions
4. Provide visualizations of the resolution process for use in the UI
5. Integrate with Azure Agents SDK for enhanced safety and reliability

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Log Collection**
   - Connect to Databricks workspaces via API
   - Collect logs from jobs, clusters, and notebooks
   - Filter relevant logs based on user-defined criteria

2. **Log Analysis**
   - Parse logs to identify common patterns of failures
   - Categorize issues (memory errors, dependency issues, permissions, etc.)
   - Generate structured analysis of the root cause

3. **Fix Suggestion**
   - Suggest potential fixes based on identified issues
   - Provide confidence level for each suggestion
   - Include reasoning for why the fix might work

4. **Fix Implementation**
   - Automatically apply suggested fixes via Databricks API
   - Support multiple fix strategies (cluster settings, library installation, etc.)
   - Keep track of attempted fixes

5. **Resolution Verification**
   - Check if the applied fix resolved the issue
   - Retry with alternative fixes up to 5 times if needed
   - Generate comprehensive report of the resolution process

### Integration Requirements
1. **Azure Agents SDK Integration**
   - Use the Azure Agents SDK for agent management
   - Implement hallucination detection for all agent responses
   - Add safety checks for all suggested fixes

2. **Logging and Tracing**
   - Implement detailed logging of all agent actions
   - Set up distributed tracing across all components
   - Enable monitoring of the agent itself

3. **UI Integration**
   - Provide reasoning loops for display in UI
   - Generate visualizations of the resolution process
   - Enable user feedback on fix suggestions

## Technical Constraints
1. Must be implemented in Python
2. Must use the latest Azure Agents SDK
3. Must implement OpenTelemetry for tracing
4. Must handle authentication securely
5. Must be scalable to monitor multiple workspaces

## Success Criteria
1. Agent can successfully identify and fix at least 80% of common Databricks issues
2. Resolution time is reduced by at least 50% compared to manual troubleshooting
3. False positives are less than 5% of all identified issues
4. Agent can explain its reasoning in a human-readable format
