    Verifies if an applied fix successfully resolved a Databricks issue.
    
    This tool performs several verification steps:
    1. Rerun the job that experienced the issue
    2. Monitor the job execution at regular intervals
    3. Analyze the results to determine if the issue has been resolved
    
    When to use:
    - After applying a fix with apply_fix()
    - To confirm that an issue has been properly resolved
    - As the final step in the monitoring and remediation workflow
