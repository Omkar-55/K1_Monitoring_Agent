# K1 Monitoring Agent - Reorganization Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Project Structure Reorganization**
   - Created a clean, modular structure with `src/` directory
   - Separated code into logical components:
     - `agent_core/`: Core functionality
     - `app/`: Streamlit application
     - `tools/`: Agent tools
     - `agents/`: Agent implementations
   - Reorganized test directories for better organization:
     - `tests/unit/`: Unit tests
     - `tests/integration/`: Integration tests

2. **Tool Implementation**
   - Created `DatabricksTools` with methods for:
     - Getting workspace status
     - Listing clusters
     - Getting cluster details
     - Listing jobs
     - Getting recent job runs
     - Retrieving logs
     - Analyzing workspace activity
   - Added `AzureOpenAITools` for AI integration:
     - Log analysis
     - Activity summarization
     - Report generation

3. **Agent Implementation**
   - Developed `MonitoringAgent` with:
     - Natural language query processing
     - Query classification using regex patterns
     - Parameter extraction from queries
     - Structured responses
     - Error handling

4. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Created a test script for the monitoring agent
   - Added comprehensive documentation to all files
   - Created README files for important directories
   - Added TODO list for future development

## Next Steps

- Move forward with the tasks outlined in TODO.md
- Focus on implementing tests to ensure reliability
- Expand the query recognition capabilities
- Add more tools for comprehensive monitoring

## File Organization

The new structure is now clean, modular, and follows best practices for Python projects:

```
.
├── src/                        # All source code
│   ├── agent_core/             # Core functionality 
│   ├── app/                    # Streamlit UI
│   ├── tools/                  # Agent tools
│   └── agents/                 # Agent implementations
│
├── tests/                      # All tests
│   ├── unit/                   # Unit tests
│   └── integration/            # Integration tests
│
├── logs/                       # Log files
├── cursor.rules                # Development guidelines
├── README.md                   # Project documentation
├── TODO.md                     # Upcoming tasks
└── SUMMARY.md                  # This summary file
```

This new structure makes the project easier to understand, maintain, and extend with new tools and agents.
